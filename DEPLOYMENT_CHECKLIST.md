# ✅ Railway Deployment Checklist

## 🚀 Pre-Deployment Verification

### Local Testing Complete ✅
- [x] Production build successful (`npm run build`)
- [x] Production server starts (`npm start`)
- [x] Health check responds at `/health`
- [x] Static files serve correctly
- [x] App loads in browser

## 🌐 Railway Deployment Steps

### 1. Repository Preparation
```bash
# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit deployment configuration
git commit -m "Add Railway production deployment configuration

- Add separate production server (server/production.ts)
- Add static file serving (server/static.ts)
- Add database health check (server/database-check.ts)
- Update Docker configuration
- Optimize build process for production"

# Push to repository
git push origin main
```

### 2. Railway Project Setup
1. Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)
2. Click **"New Project"**
3. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. Choose your gym management repository
5. Railway will start initial deployment

### 3. Environment Variables Configuration
In Railway dashboard → **Variables** tab, add:

```env
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://your_db_connection_string
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_key
```

**Important Notes:**
- Railway auto-sets `PORT` - don't add manually
- For database, you can add PostgreSQL service in Railway for free
- Get Gemini API key from: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

### 4. Database Service (Optional)
If you need a new database:
1. In Railway dashboard, click **"Add Service"**
2. Select **"PostgreSQL"**
3. Railway will auto-generate `DATABASE_URL`
4. Connect to your project

### 5. Deploy & Monitor
- Railway automatically deploys on code push
- Monitor build logs in Railway dashboard
- Check deployment status

## 🔍 Post-Deployment Verification

### Check These Endpoints:
- [ ] `https://your-app.up.railway.app` - Main app loads
- [ ] `https://your-app.up.railway.app/health` - Returns status: ok
- [ ] Test user registration/login
- [ ] Test AI workout generation
- [ ] Test client management features

### Database Setup (if new DB):
```bash
# Run migrations on production database
npm run db:push
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions:

**Build Fails:**
- Check logs in Railway dashboard
- Verify all dependencies are in package.json
- Test `npm run build` locally

**Database Connection Error:**
- Verify DATABASE_URL format
- Check database allows external connections
- Run database migrations

**App Won't Load:**
- Check if build completed successfully
- Verify static files are served
- Check health endpoint first

**Environment Variables:**
- Double-check variable names (case-sensitive)
- Restart deployment after adding variables
